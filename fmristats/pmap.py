    A population map is a diffeomorphism from a population space to the
    reference space of a FMRI session.

    Parameters
    ----------
    diffeomorphism : subclass of Diffeomorphism
        The diffeomorphism ψ that maps from vb (the population space) to
        nb (the subject space).
    vb : None, Image or ndarray
        An image in population space.
    nb : None, Image or ndarray
        An image in subject space.
    vb_background : None, Image or ndarray
        An image in population space.
    nb_background : None, Image or ndarray
        An image in subject space.
    vb_estimate : None, Image or ndarray
        An image in population space.
    nb_estimate : None, Image or ndarray
        An image in subject space.
    vb_mask : None, Image or array
        An image in population space.
    nb_mask : None, Image or array
        An image in subject space.
    vb_ati : None, Image or array
        An image in population space that will serve as the reference
        field for the BOLD unit.

    Notes
    -----
    If vb (or any of the other arguments) is an Image, it will be
    checked whether its *reference affine* agrees with the reference
    affine of the diffeomorphism ψ.  If vb is an ndarray, its shape must
    be equal to the shape of the diffeomorphism, as it will then be
    assumed that they share the same reference affine: the vb's
    reference will be set identical to the reference of the
    diffeomorphism.

    If the software which has been used to fit the diffeomorphism
    creates a warped images of its inputs, they can be stored in
    `vb_estimate` and `nb_estimate` respectively.

    There appears to be no clear naming convention for images in `vb`
    and `nb`. Examples for images in `vb` and `nb` are `input`,
    `target`, `template`, `reference`, `moving`, `fixed`, and more: The
    intuitive meaning of what these images shall represent is often (and
    not always) clear from the context, but the question which of these
    images live in `vb` or `nb` is ambiguous at best. Say, when fitting
    a diffeomorphism providing an algorithm with the arguments
    `reference` and `input` (FNIRT) or `fixed` and `moving` (ANTS): does
    the diffeomorphism go from `reference` to `input` or vice versa?
